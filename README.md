# Face Detection and Recognition using PyTorch

This project implements a real-time face detection and recognition system using PyTorch. The system can identify and label faces in both images and video streams.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎯 Face Detection using Faster R-CNN
- 🧠 Face Recognition using FaceNet (InceptionResNetV1 backbone)
- 📸 Real-time detection and recognition using OpenCV
- 🗂️ Structured training, validation, and test datasets
- 📁 Modular notebooks and scripts for training and testing

## 🧪 How it Works

### 1. Face Detection (Faster R-CNN)
Trained on labeled face images using XML annotations. The detector identifies and returns bounding boxes of faces in an image or video.

### 2. Face Recognition (FaceNet)
The FaceNet model learns embeddings of faces, allowing it to match new faces with labeled identities from the training dataset.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Requirements

```bash
pip install torch torchvision facenet-pytorch opencv-python matplotlib Pillow lxml
```
📷 Real-Time Recognition
Use your webcam to detect and recognize faces in real-time:
python CV2+FasterRCNN.py      # Run face detection
python CV2+faceNet.py         # Run face recognition

🧠 Training
➤ Train Faster R-CNN
Run the Jupyter notebook:

📊 Dataset
Images organized into folders per person (train/, valid/, test/)

Annotations for detection are in Pascal VOC XML format

Each identity has ~100 training images, 50 validation images
