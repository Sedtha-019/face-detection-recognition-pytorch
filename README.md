# face-detection-recognition-pytorch

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for real-time face detection and recognition using PyTorch. It uses Faster R-CNN for accurate face detection and FaceNet for face identification/recognition. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing multiple faces in live video streams or static images.
